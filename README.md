# Find Elapsed Days between two given dates

An application to calculate the full elapsed days between any two given dates excluding the given dates. Application accepts input from command-Line/Terminal.

## PROBLEM
You have joined a science project as the latest team member. Scientists on the project are running a series of experiments and need to calculate the number of full days elapsed in between the experimentâ€™s start and end dates, i.e. the first and the last day are considered partial days and never counted. Following this logic, an experiment that has run from 07/11/1972 and 08/11/1972 should return 0, because there are no fully elapsed days contained in between those dates, and 01/01/2000 to 03/01/2000 should return 1. The solution needs to cater for all valid dates between 01/01/1901 and 31/12/2999.

### TEST CASES (DD/MM/YYYY)
1. 02/06/1983 - 22/06/1983: 19 days
2. 04/07/1984 - 25/12/1984: 173 days
3. 03/08/1983 - 03/01/1989: 1979 days

## Getting Started

To compile and run the application and tests on your local machine, download the Source (com) to a local directory on your local machine. JUnit Test cases are also included. Alternatively you can download the project to IDE like Eclipse or IntelliJ Idea.

### Pre-requisites

To run the application you need Java Runtime Environment 8 on your local machine which can be downloaded from the below link.
* [JRE Download](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html)

To compile the application you need Java Development Kit 8 on your local machine which can be downloaded from the below link.
* [JDK Download](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)

To run the tests you need JUnit which can be downloaded and installed from the below link. Alternatively you can include following JARs in your test classpath:
* [JUnit Download](https://github.com/junit-team/junit4/wiki/Download-and-Install)
* junit-4.12.jar
* hamcrest-all-1.3.jar

## Compiling the application

1. Open Command-Line or Terminal on you local machine.
2. Change the directory to parent directory of the extracted FindElapsedDays.zip file.
3. Compile the application as below.

```
$ javac com/myndful/challenge/FindElapsedDays.java
```

## Running the application

1. Open Command-Line or Terminal on you local machine.
2. Change the directory to parent directory of the source.
3. Input Start date and End date in Command-Line or Terminal. Both dates should be in DD/MM/YYYY format and ensure Start date is before End date for correct result.
4. Run the application as below.

```
$ java com/myndful/challenge/FindElapsedDays 01/02/2011 15/02/2011

Result:

Full days elapsed between 01/02/2011 and 15/02/2011 : 13
```

## Running the tests

1. Open Command-Line or Terminal on you local machine.
2. Change the directory to parent directory of the source (com).
3. Ensure following JARs are in your classpath:
* junit-4.12.jar
* hamcrest-all-1.3.jar

4. compile tests cases as below.

```
$ javac com/myndful/challenge/FindElapsedDaysTest.java com/myndful/challenge/TestRunner.java
```

5. Run tests as below.

```
$ java com/myndful/challenge/TestRunner
```

Note: All the test cases mentioned in the problem statement along with some additional test cases are included in the tests.
